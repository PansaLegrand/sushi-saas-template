## What is Sushi SaaS?

Sushi SaaS is a pragmatic, production‑oriented Next.js starter for building and launching real SaaS products. It ships the pieces you actually need on day one—authentication, billing, admin, content, and internationalization—wired together with a typed database and explicit migrations.

Core stack:

- Next.js App Router with localized routes (next‑intl)
- Better Auth + Postgres via Drizzle ORM
- Stripe Checkout + webhook finalization (credits ledger ready)
- MDX docs/blogs via Fumadocs (with SEO metadata + JSON‑LD)
- Admin pages with server‑enforced RBAC
- Sensible DX: pnpm, ESLint/Tailwind, health endpoint, clear envs

GitHub repository: https://github.com/PansaLegrand/saas-sushi-template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PansaLegrand/saas-sushi-template.git
cd saas-sushi-template
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## Why you can rely on it

- Typed from data to UI: Drizzle schemas are the single source of truth; drizzle‑kit migrations keep your database in sync.
- Real flows, not stubs: Auth, billing (Stripe), and admin permissions are connected and exercised in the UI.
- Predictable i18n: Route‑prefixed locales with next‑intl; messages live beside the app and docs.
- Operational clarity: `/api/health`, explicit env templates, and repository guidelines for builds, lint, and migrations.
- Clear documentation: Every major capability (auth, billing, database, admin, emails) has an MDX guide with practical commands and file references.
- Proven in the wild: The template reflects patterns used to ship real products (e.g., https://dojoclip.com, https://sushi-templates.com).

## What makes it unique

- MIT License: Use it commercially, modify it freely, and move fast. See `LICENSE` in the repository.
- Full‑feature starter: Auth, billing, credits ledger, affiliates, reservations demo, MDX docs, admin, and i18n are ready out of the box.
- Built‑in content + SEO: Frontmatter → Next.js metadata + OpenGraph + JSON‑LD for every MDX page.
- Author consultancy available: Need help adapting this to your use case? The author offers implementation and advisory services so you can ship faster with confidence. Email: pansalegrand@gmail.com (English, French, Chinese — working proficiency)

## What you get on day one

- Authentication & RBAC: Better Auth, typed DB adapter, secure admin with read‑only/read‑write roles.
- Billing that sticks: Stripe Checkout sessions + signed webhooks to finalize and grant credits.
- Credits & orders: A simple ledger to power usage‑based products and free trials.
- Internationalization: Locale‑prefixed routes, message bundles, and localized docs.
- MDX documentation: Fumadocs‑powered developer and product docs with navigation and TOC.
- Developer experience: pnpm, Turbopack/Webpack toggle, ESLint/Tailwind, and repository conventions.

## Why I built this open‑source project

I started Sushi SaaS to connect with other builders and to keep myself shipping. Open source makes that possible: it invites real conversations, sparks side projects, and sometimes opens the door to join a startup.

- Connection and momentum: I want to meet collaborators, explore side projects, and—if the chemistry is right—be part of a startup. Publishing real, working code is the best conversation starter I know.
- Better software through openness: Boilerplates only get great when people use them, critique them, and improve them. This is my version of building in public—without a monetary incentive—just the joy of coding and seeing others build on top.
