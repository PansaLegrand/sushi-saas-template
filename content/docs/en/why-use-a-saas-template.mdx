## Why Use a SaaS Template (and When You Shouldn’t)

Outcome: By the end of this guide, you’ll know how SaaS boilerplate templates can accelerate your development (saving you months of work) and when it might be better to build from scratch. We’ll also dispel the “lock-in” myths around using templates, so you understand how to avoid any “framework prison” scenarios.

## The Time-Saving Power of Templates

Building a SaaS product from scratch often means spending enormous time on foundational features that users simply expect (but don’t explicitly value) – things like authentication, subscription billing, user account management, admin dashboards, etc. Instead of working on your app’s unique features, you can end up reinventing the basics for months. For example, one indie hacker tallied up the typical effort for essential SaaS components and found it came out to 13–19 weeks of foundational work before writing any business logic <a href="https://jamiemaguire.net/index.php/2025/09/26/why-i-built-a-saas-boilerplate-and-why-you-should-use-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. Think about that – nearly 3 to 5 months just to get features like sign-up, login, payments, and basic UI in place! And these aren’t even the innovative parts of your app – they’re the “table stakes” features every SaaS needs.

To put it bluntly, developers often waste 60–70% of their initial development time on features users take for granted <a href="https://jamiemaguire.net/index.php/2025/09/26/why-i-built-a-saas-boilerplate-and-why-you-should-use-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a> – not on the special sauce that actually differentiates the product. It’s no wonder morale can drop when weeks have passed and you’re still plumbing the login system or tweaking the billing logic. As one author noted, “before you even touch your ‘special sauce,’ you’ll spend months reinventing the basics… These aren’t unique features, yet they swallow up developer hours.” <a href="https://pratikmistry.medium.com/boilerplate-vs-building-from-scratch-what-to-pick-in-2025-09d99116b74d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a> In today’s fast-moving startup world, spending that much time on undifferentiated groundwork is a luxury (and risk) few can afford.

SaaS templates provide pre-built code for common features – like auth, payments, and admin – giving developers a massive head start. By using a template, you can skip the repetitive groundwork and focus on what makes your product unique.

This is where SaaS templates (a.k.a. boilerplates or starter kits) shine. A good SaaS template comes with all those common features pre-built – user auth flows, subscription management, internationalization (i18n) support, admin interfaces, etc. – so you don’t have to build them from scratch. Instead of spending weeks on login screens and Stripe webhooks, you can plug in a template and have those pieces working on day one. Modern boilerplate projects aren’t just code snippets or demos; they’re often robust, production-ready foundations that incorporate industry best practices from the start <a href="https://pratikmistry.medium.com/boilerplate-vs-building-from-scratch-what-to-pick-in-2025-09d99116b74d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>. In practical terms, using a template can let you ship your product in a matter of days or weeks instead of months <a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/saas-boilerplate-vs-custom-code?ref=blogs.usesaaskit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a><a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/saas-boilerplate-vs-custom-code?ref=blogs.usesaaskit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a>. By launching sooner, you can start gathering user feedback, iterating on core features, and even generating revenue, all while your competitors might still be fiddling with boilerplate code.

## Real-World Example: Months Saved on Basics

To illustrate the impact, consider the story of a developer who built a SaaS habit-tracker app followed by an AI note-taking app. Both times, he found himself writing the same user registration system, the same Stripe billing integration, the same email notifications – “Every. Single. Time.” After the second project, he had an epiphany: all this repetitive work was a huge drag on his timeline and motivation <a href="https://jamiemaguire.net/index.php/2025/09/26/why-i-built-a-saas-boilerplate-and-why-you-should-use-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a><a href="https://jamiemaguire.net/index.php/2025/09/26/why-i-built-a-saas-boilerplate-and-why-you-should-use-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a>. In fact, he calculated that building those standard pieces took about 13–19 weeks (and roughly $13k–$19k worth of developer effort) for each project <a href="https://jamiemaguire.net/index.php/2025/09/26/why-i-built-a-saas-boilerplate-and-why-you-should-use-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[9]</a>. So he created a reusable SaaS template for himself, and suddenly his new ideas went from concept to launch in a fraction of the time. Many other founders have similar experiences – the first version of your product can come together much faster when you start with a template that already handles authentication, payments, subscriptions, and responsive UI out of the box <a href="https://jamiemaguire.net/index.php/2025/09/26/why-i-built-a-saas-boilerplate-and-why-you-should-use-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a>.

The takeaway: if your goal is to get to market quickly and not lose momentum, a SaaS template can save you months of wheel-reinventing. It lets you devote your energy to the truly novel parts of your application. As a bonus, those template-provided features are often implemented in line with best practices (since they’re used across many apps), meaning you’re less likely to introduce security holes or performance issues in those areas. In short, a quality boilerplate isn’t a “shortcut” in a negative sense – it’s an accelerator that handles the undifferentiated heavy lifting, so you can build the features that truly matter for your users <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/saas-boilerplate-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/saas-boilerplate-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[12]</a>.

## Busting the “Framework Prison” Myth

One common concern about using a template or starter kit is the fear of “lock-in” – the idea that you’ll be trapped in someone else’s framework or architecture (a so-called framework prison). Skeptics worry that if you base your code on a template, you might hit a wall later: what if you need to do something the template’s structure doesn’t easily allow? What if you become dependent on the template maker for updates or fixes? These are valid questions – but they can be answered by choosing the right kind of template and understanding how it’s built.

First, it’s crucial to distinguish between closed, proprietary platforms and open-source code templates. A SaaS template that is open-source (for example, released under an MIT license) gives you complete access to the code. You can modify anything in it, replace components, or even fork it and go in a different direction. You have clear ownership of your codebase – the template is really just a starting point. Because the code is yours, there’s no external vendor holding the keys. In other words, a well-designed open template provides structure without locking you in. As one tech author put it, a good boilerplate “gives you speed without compromising quality, structure without locking you in, and security you can trust from the first commit” <a href="https://pratikmistry.medium.com/boilerplate-vs-building-from-scratch-what-to-pick-in-2025-09d99116b74d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[13]</a>. You benefit from the organized foundation, but you remain in control of your app’s destiny.

Additionally, modern templates tend to use mainstream, typed languages (like TypeScript) and follow standard frameworks. This means the code is easier to understand and refactor. Strong typing and clean architecture make it safer to customize parts of the template because you’ll get compile-time feedback if you break something. For instance, the MakerKit SaaS starter (a popular boilerplate) emphasizes having “clean, customizable, and strictly typed code for optimal maintainability,” precisely so developers can adapt it without fear <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/saas-boilerplate-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[14]</a>. In practice, that means if you want to swap out the email service or tweak the data model, you can do so with confidence – you’re not confined to some black-box “framework jail.”

It’s true that not all templates are created equal. If a boilerplate is overly opinionated or poorly documented, you could find yourself spending time deciphering someone else’s design. In fact, some developers have reported frustration with certain starter kits that were so modular or abstract that making a simple change required editing ten different files <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1d8giec/i_found_all_saas_templates_for_starter_on_reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[15]</a>. The good news is that you can avoid this by vetting the template before you commit to it (we’ll provide a checklist shortly). Look for templates with a reputation for clear code and flexibility. Reading the docs or source can tell you if the code is understandable or if it’s a convoluted mess.

Importantly, the “lock-in” fear is largely a myth when you use open-source templates. Unlike a closed SaaS builder or proprietary plugin, an open template doesn’t impose long-term constraints. If down the road you decide to overhaul a part of the system, you have the source and the rights to do it. And because you started with popular frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Django, etc.), you’re never stuck with an obscure technology. In the unlikely scenario that you truly outgrow the initial architecture, you can gradually refactor or replace it – just as you would with any custom codebase. In summary, a quality template should feel like your own code from day one, not an external cage. Choose one that is typed, open, and well-documented, and you’ll avoid the “framework prison” while enjoying a big head start.

Tip: One often overlooked factor is the license and cost model of the template. Many reputable SaaS starters are completely free and open-source, while others are sold commercially. Paid boilerplates can run anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for essentially the same code you’d otherwise write yourself <a href="https://dev.to/wasp/the-best-free-open-source-saas-template-for-react-nodejs-263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[16]</a>. If you’re worried about being tied down, a free MIT-licensed template is ideal – you won’t have to worry about license fees, usage limits, or the vendor going away. (For example, the Sushi SaaS template is MIT licensed, meaning you can use it in your own product without restriction, and even commercialize that product, with no strings attached.) In addition, some open-source template authors offer consulting or support services separately – so you get the benefit of professional help if needed, but without any dependency or lock-in in the code itself.

## When Does a Template Not Make Sense?

While SaaS templates are great in many scenarios, there are times when they might not be the best fit. It’s important to recognize these cases so you don’t force a template on a project that would be better off starting fresh. Here are some situations where you might not want to use a template:

Highly “exotic” or unique architectures: If your application has requirements far outside the norm, a one-size-fits-all template may not cover it. For example, imagine you’re building a cutting-edge AI platform with a custom data pipeline, or a real-time IoT system with unusual performance constraints. In such cases, you might need to craft the architecture very specifically. One author noted that “if you’re building something wildly unique… [building from scratch] might give you the freedom you need.” <a href="https://pratikmistry.medium.com/boilerplate-vs-building-from-scratch-what-to-pick-in-2025-09d99116b74d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[17]</a> A generic starter kit could impose structures that don’t align with your needs, and you’d spend more time undoing or bending the template than it’s worth.

Teams with a strong existing stack or prior codebase: If you and your team already have an established way of doing things – say you have a mature in-house framework or a codebase you’ve evolved over years – dropping a boilerplate on top of that might be counterproductive. Teams with established code may find integrating a template “more trouble than it’s worth” <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/saas-boilerplate-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[18]</a>. In other words, if you already have user management and billing solved in your stack, you likely don’t need a template’s version of it. Templates excel for new projects; for an existing project, it’s usually better to gradually improve that project’s code than to try to merge in a boilerplate.

Extremely specialized feature set: Similar to exotic architecture, if your product’s core functionality is very far from what most SaaS apps do, a boilerplate’s included features might be irrelevant. In those cases, you might be better off starting tailored from the ground up. Remember, templates shine by covering the common denominators of SaaS apps (auth, payments, CRUD interfaces, etc.). If your app has almost none of those in common, a template won’t save you much time.

Learning and control preferences: Some developers simply prefer to build everything themselves for learning purposes or for ultimate control. If you’re the type who wants to hand-craft every part of the system and you have the time to do so, you might consciously choose not to use a template. Building from scratch gives full control over every line of code and can be a valuable learning experience (albeit slower). Just be sure you’re doing this for the right reasons – i.e. you genuinely need that control or learning – and not due to a misconception that using a template is “cheating.” Remember, even if you roll your own, you’ll likely end up implementing the same patterns that a good boilerplate would provide you upfront.

To be clear, most typical SaaS projects do benefit from a template, especially in the early stages. But you should consider custom development when your app has special, unique requirements that don’t fit a standard setup <a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/saas-boilerplate-vs-custom-code?ref=blogs.usesaaskit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[19]</a> or when your team’s expertise and existing assets make a template unnecessary. In those cases, the flexibility of custom code might outweigh the jump-start a template provides.

## Audit Checklist: Choosing the Right Template

Let’s say you’ve decided a SaaS template makes sense for your project – how do you pick the right one and avoid the pitfalls? Below is an audit checklist you can use before adopting any template. It addresses common questions (the “long-tail” questions like Will I outgrow it?, Is it safe for production?, and How much can I customize?) and key factors to evaluate:

- ✅ Tech Stack Compatibility: Does the template use the languages and frameworks you’re comfortable with? Ensure the boilerplate matches your preferred frontend, backend, and database tech. Adopting a template built on Angular when your team only knows React, for example, will create friction <a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/what-is-a-saas-boilerplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[20]</a>. The goal is to save time, not spend weeks learning an entirely new stack. Choose a template that aligns with the tools you already use or are eager to use.
- ✅ Core Features Coverage: Make a list of the “must-have” basics for your SaaS (auth, payments, i18n, file uploads, etc.) and see if the template provides them. A good boilerplate will include most of these out of the box <a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/what-is-a-saas-boilerplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[21]</a><a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/what-is-a-saas-boilerplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[22]</a>. If you have specific needs (e.g. multi-tenant support or a particular third-party integration), check for those as well. You don’t want to pick a template and then immediately have to build a missing essential feature from scratch.
- ✅ Code Quality & Best Practices: Evaluate the template’s code structure and conventions. Is it following modern best practices (secure password storage, responsive design, accessible markup, etc.)? Many templates are created by experienced developers and optimized for long-term use, with security and scalability in mind <a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/what-is-a-saas-boilerplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[23]</a>. Look for signs of clean architecture: layered separation of concerns, meaningful naming, presence of tests, and typed code. A quick read of the documentation or source can reveal if the codebase is clean or a spaghetti mess. Remember, if you adopt it, that code becomes your code – so make sure it’s something you’ll be comfortable maintaining.
- ✅ Documentation and Community: Check for documentation, guides, or a community around the template. Clear docs are invaluable for speeding up your onboarding to the codebase <a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/what-is-a-saas-boilerplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[24]</a>. Some templates have active Discord or Slack communities or at least a history of answered issues in their repository. This kind of support can be a lifesaver when you run into questions. It’s also a sign that the template is well-maintained. If the template’s GitHub repo has seen no updates or the author doesn’t respond to issues, that’s a red flag. Reputable boilerplates typically offer ongoing support and updates to keep up with the latest tech stacks <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/saas-boilerplate-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[25]</a>.
- ✅ License and Cost: Understand the licensing. Is it open-source (MIT, Apache, etc.) or a paid product with a commercial license? There’s nothing wrong with paying for a quality starter kit, but you should ensure it fits your budget and that the license won’t restrict your intended use. Some paid templates don’t allow multiple projects or have other limits. If you prefer to avoid that, choose an open-source option. Also, as mentioned earlier, free doesn’t mean inferior – many free templates are excellent (they often monetize through optional services instead). MIT-licensed templates give you maximal freedom, which means you’ll never have to “outgrow” the license.
- ✅ Will You Outgrow It? This is a common concern: will the template scale with you, or will you hit a ceiling? The truth is, if you choose a well-built template on a solid platform, you are unlikely to outgrow it quickly. For example, many startups have scaled to thousands of users on top of boilerplate frameworks without issue <a href="https://www.sidetool.co/post/top-10-no-code-saas-templates-to-launch-quickly-and-efficiently/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[26]</a>. A good template will use proven technologies (databases, frameworks) that can be scaled and extended. You should, however, review the template’s design for flexibility – e.g., can you add new database fields or modules without pain? In most cases, you can. One guide on no-code templates (analogous concept) noted that if you hit a limit, you can extend it with custom code or use the success of your MVP to justify rewriting parts later, but “for a huge range of SaaS products, you may never need to switch.” <a href="https://www.sidetool.co/post/top-10-no-code-saas-templates-to-launch-quickly-and-efficiently/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[27]</a> The key is choosing a template that’s documented and not overly rigid. If it’s built with standard stack pieces, you can always replace or refactor parts as your app evolves. In essence, you shouldn’t worry about outgrowing the template until your product is very successful – at which point, that’s a good problem to have (and you’ll have more resources to remodel if needed). As one founder advised, there’s nothing wrong with using a starter kit to launch and validate quickly; you can always “develop a more robust solution later when early success warrants that investment” <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/saas-starter-kit-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[28]</a>.
- ✅ Is It Safe for Production? A template is supposed to be production-ready, but do verify this. Look for evidence of security best practices (for example, secure auth flows, protection against common vulnerabilities, GDPR compliance considerations, etc.) and quality of implementation. Check if the template uses up-to-date dependencies and frameworks (an outdated template might not be secure). Many boilerplates emphasize that they follow industry standards for exactly this reason <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/saas-boilerplate-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[29]</a><a href="https://www.usesaaskit.com/blog/what-is-a-saas-boilerplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[23]</a>. If available, see if other apps or companies are using the template in production – that’s a great validation. Generally, if the template is well-maintained by an experienced author or team, you can trust it for production use. Of course, you should still do your own due diligence: treat it as you would your own code, and do a security pass (e.g. check configurations, API keys, etc.) when setting up. But you’ll likely find the heavy lifting has been done.
- ✅ How Much Can You Customize? You should plan to customize any template to some degree – at minimum to apply your branding, and at maximum to build completely new features. The question is, how easily can you do so? A good template makes customization straightforward for the common things. For instance, it might have config files where you can set your app name, logo, color theme, etc., in minutes (so you’re not stuck with the template’s branding). Many also provide a modular structure that lets you enable/disable features. Check the docs for sections on theming or configuration. Also, look at the code organization: is it easy to follow and modify? As noted, strongly typed code and clean separation of concerns will make it much easier to tweak or extend functionality <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/saas-boilerplate-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[14]</a>. Expect that you will remove some parts you don’t need and add some that are unique to your app. That’s normal – the template is a starting point, not the finish line. The good news is, even after adding your custom features, you’ve still saved enormous time on the basics. One expert pointed out that there is usually a small learning curve (maybe a few hours to get familiar with the template’s structure), and you might strip out a few modules that aren’t needed, but those few hours are worth it to save many weeks of development <a href="https://pratikmistry.medium.com/boilerplate-vs-building-from-scratch-what-to-pick-in-2025-09d99116b74d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[30]</a>. In summary, plan for customization, but if the template is well-designed, it should feel like adding and adjusting code in any well-organized project.

Using this checklist, you can confidently evaluate and choose a SaaS template that fits your needs. The goal is to harness the productivity boost of a boilerplate while mitigating any downsides through smart selection and usage.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

In conclusion, using a SaaS template can be a game-changer for your productivity. It’s like standing on the shoulders of giants – you get a leg up with all the boilerplate done, allowing you to focus on the innovation and value that will make your SaaS succeed. We’ve seen that templates can save you time, money, and headaches, all while following best practices that you might overlook when rushed. And thanks to open-source licenses and modern design, you don’t have to fear being “locked in” – you retain full control and can evolve the code as your app grows. The key is to be strategic: pick a template that fits your tech stack and requirements, and leverage it as a solid foundation.

Ready to accelerate your SaaS development? One great way to put these insights into practice is to explore the Sushi SaaS template (our own production-ready SaaS starter kit). It’s a Next.js 15 based template that comes with everything we’ve discussed – authentication (powered by Better Auth), subscription billing, i18n routing, admin dashboard, and more – all wired up and following best practices. The Sushi SaaS template is completely open-source (MIT licensed), so you can use it freely in your project and customize every aspect. In fact, you’re encouraged to dig into the code. Check out the project’s Showcase and browse the code on GitHub – for instance, look at the lib/, providers/, and services/ directories to see how things are implemented. You’ll find a clean, typed codebase that you can take ownership of from day one.

Moreover, the author of Sushi SaaS offers consulting services for template users. This means if you need a bit of extra help – say, integrating an exotic feature or scaling out your deployment – you have the option to get guidance straight from the creator. It’s like having the template’s architect on your team when you need them.

Call to Action: Don’t let boilerplate coding bog you down. Consider giving the Sushi SaaS template (or a similar reputable SaaS starter) a try for your next project. Clone it, run it, and see how quickly you can get a fully functional SaaS app up and running. Use it as-is or tailor it to your needs – the point is, you’ll be miles ahead of where you’d be starting from a blank repository. By using a template smartly, you can focus on what truly matters: delivering value to your users and growing your SaaS business, without getting caught in the weeds of re-building the same foundation every time. Good luck, and happy coding!
