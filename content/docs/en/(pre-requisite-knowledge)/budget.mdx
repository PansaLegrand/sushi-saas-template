## TL;DR

You can launch a working SaaS for a few dollars per month — and often $0 at the beginning using free tiers. Spend money only when you have usage or income.

## How much does it cost to start a SaaS?

For an MVP, your cash costs can be close to zero:

- Domain: typically $10–$20/year (optional for the very first tests).
- Repo/CI: GitHub + basic CI are free for most needs.
- App and DB: Vercel and Neon both offer generous free tiers.
- Payments: Stripe has no monthly fee; you pay per successful charge.
- Email: Resend has a free plan; great for onboarding and notifications.

Typical first month: $0–$10 if you keep things lean.

## How much does hosting cost?

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/pricing): Free Hobby plan covers a small SaaS nicely (serverless + edge). You’ll only pay when you need higher limits, advanced features, or significant traffic.
- Alternatives: You can also run on your own VM or containers, but that generally costs more up front and increases ops complexity.

Bottom line: Start free, upgrade when you hit usage caps.

## What about the database?

- [Neon](https://neon.tech/pricing): Free Postgres tier is enough for development and early users. Upgrade when you need more storage, compute, or features.
- Local dev: You can also develop locally and only provision a managed DB for staging/prod when needed.

## What does Stripe cost?

Stripe’s pricing is region‑dependent and per‑transaction. There’s usually no monthly fee — you pay when you get paid. In test mode, it’s free to integrate and end‑to‑end test. See [Stripe pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing) and feel free to [contact Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/) for your country’s exact rates.

If you’re unsure, contact Stripe support for your country’s exact rates.

## What does email cost?

- [Resend](https://resend.com/pricing): Free plan available. Great to get started for sign‑ups, verifications, and simple notifications.
- As you scale: You might need a paid tier for higher volume, dedicated IPs, or deliverability controls.

## Major areas where money actually goes

- Domain + DNS: custom domain, SSL, DNS services.
- Email + inboxes: transactional email (Resend) and possibly a support inbox.
- Storage + media: user uploads, images, and backups.
- Monitoring + logs: error tracking, performance metrics, observability.
- Background jobs + queues: scheduled tasks, long‑running jobs.
- Analytics + tooling: product analytics, A/B testing, feature flags.
- Legal + compliance: terms/privacy, accounting, taxes, PCI/DSA/GDPR needs.
- Design + content: icons, templates, copy, marketing.
- Your time: the biggest cost early on.

You can defer many of these until you have traction.

---

## A simple budget by phase

- Pre‑PMF MVP: $0–$10/month (free tiers + domain).
- Early launch: $20–$100/month (when you outgrow free limits).
- Growing: $100–$500+/month (depends on volume and team needs).

## Encouragement for beginners

Start now. Use free tiers (Vercel, Neon, Resend) and integrate Stripe in test mode. Ship a thin slice, talk to users, and only pay when you actually need more capacity. A few dollars are enough to run a basic SaaS — the best investment is validating the idea as early as possible.
