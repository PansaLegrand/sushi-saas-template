Setting up the database is the only “backend” work you need before the new
authentication screens start working. This guide walks you through the tooling
we ship (Drizzle ORM), the typical database scenarios, the files you have to
edit, and the commands you must run afterwards.

## 1. What is Drizzle ORM?

We use **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** as the type-safe layer
between TypeScript and Postgres. The schema in `src/db/schema.ts` is the single
source of truth. From that file we can:

- Generate migration SQL with `drizzle-kit`
- Run migrations against Postgres
- Share types across the app (e.g. `users.$inferSelect`)

You do **not** edit SQL directly; you edit the schema file and let Drizzle create
and apply migrations for you.

## 2. Pick your database scenario

There is no one-size-fits-all setup. Choose the scenario that best matches your
stack and update `.env` accordingly.

| Scenario | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| **Local development only** | Run Postgres via Docker (e.g. `docker run ... postgres:16`) and point `DATABASE_URL` to `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`. |
| **Managed Postgres (Neon, Supabase, Railway, Render…)** | Grab the pooled connection string provided by the service. Make sure the IP you run migrations from is allowed. |
| **Different DB per environment** | Keep `.env` for local development, store production secrets in your hosting provider, and override `DATABASE_URL` there. |
| **Existing Postgres with other tables** | Drizzle will only touch the tables declared in `src/db/schema.ts`. Ensure table names do not clash and consider namespacing with schemas if needed. |

> Tip: Drizzle cannot create the database itself. Create the empty database
> first (with your provider UI or psql) before running migrations.

## 3. Configure environment variables

Define the connection string and Better Auth secrets. We read from `.env`,
`.env.local`, and `.env.development` by default.

```bash  title=".env"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db?sslmode=require"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

Restart `pnpm dev` after changing env files so the process picks up the new
values.

## 4. Understand the schema files

- `src/db/schema.ts` – Drizzle models for **Better Auth** (`users`, `sessions`,
  `accounts`, `verifications`) and the app tables (`orders`, `credits`, etc.).
- `src/db/config.ts` – The drizzle-kit configuration pointing at the schema and
  Postgres URL.
- `src/lib/auth.ts` – Maps Better Auth fields to the Drizzle tables. Update this
  file if you rename columns in the `users` table.

When you need new columns or tables, update `schema.ts` and, if relevant, the
field mapping inside `auth.ts`.

## 5. Generate migrations after code changes

Whenever `schema.ts` changes, run:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit generate --config src/db/config.ts
```

Expected output (example):

```
Reading config file 'src/db/config.ts'
10 tables
...
[✓] Your SQL migration file ➜ src/db/migrations/0002_add_user_flag.sql 🚀
```

The command creates two files:

- `src/db/migrations/<timestamp>_*.sql` – the SQL that will run
- `src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json` – drizzle’s migration ledger

Commit both files to version control.

## 6. Apply migrations to Postgres

Run the generated SQL against your database:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate --config src/db/config.ts
```

Typical success output:

```
Applying migrations from src/db/migrations
Migration 0002_add_user_flag.sql executed in 380 ms
All migrations applied!
```

If you see authentication errors, re-check `DATABASE_URL`. If the command hangs
or times out, confirm that your IP is whitelisted (managed Postgres) or that the
container is running (local Postgres).

## 7. Validate the result

Use any Postgres client to spot-check the new tables/columns. For example with
`psql`:

```sql
\dt            -- list tables
SELECT * FROM sessions LIMIT 1;
SELECT email_verified FROM users LIMIT 1;
```

You should see the Better Auth tables plus any columns you recently added.

## 8. Try the auth flow

Once migrations are applied, restart `pnpm dev`, open `/en/signup`, and create a
user. You should be redirected to the home page and a new record should appear
in `users` and `sessions`.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- **Error: model "userss" not found** – Ensure `src/lib/auth.ts` references the
  correct table name (`users`). Remove the `usePlural` option if you copied it
  from older snippets.
- **Column missing during sign-in** – You changed `schema.ts` but forgot to run
  `generate` + `migrate`. Regenerate and apply the migration.
- **Cannot connect to database** – Confirm the database exists, credentials are
  correct, SSL flags match, and the network allows inbound connections.
- **Need a clean slate** – Drop the tables manually or use `drizzle-kit`’s sql
  to revert, then re-run `generate` and `migrate`.

Keep these steps in mind whenever you evolve the schema. Edit the code, generate
migrations, apply them, and verify—you will avoid 500 errors in the auth flows.
