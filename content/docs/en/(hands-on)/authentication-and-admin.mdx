# Authentication & Admin

This template uses Better Auth + Drizzle for authentication and sessions. A simple, DB‑backed RBAC layer adds two admin roles on top of regular users. Roles are stored in the database only (no env-based elevation).

## Basics: Authentication vs. Authorization

- Authentication: Proves who you are (sign‑in/sign‑up). The result is a session.
- Authorization: Decides what you can do after sign‑in. In this template, a `role` on the `users` table controls access.

Roles we use:

- `user` – default for everyone.
- `admin_ro` – read‑only admin (can view admin data, no writes).
- `admin_rw` – read + write admin (includes granting credits and other admin actions).

### A simple analogy

At an airport, showing your ID to security is authentication (proving identity). Presenting your boarding pass at the gate is authorization (verifying you’re allowed on that flight).

### Quick comparison

| Topic | Authentication | Authorization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Verify identity (who you are) | Verify permissions (what you can do) |
| When | Before authorization | After successful authentication |
| Typical inputs | Credentials (password, email link, social sign‑in) | Policies/roles (e.g., `user`, `admin_ro`, `admin_rw`) |
| Output | A session/identity | Allowed actions and protected routes |
| Common standards (general) | OpenID Connect (OIDC), ID tokens | OAuth 2.0, access scopes |

In this template: we use secure, HttpOnly session cookies on the server (not front‑end tokens) and a simple role field on `users` to drive authorization checks.

## What is Better Auth?

Better Auth is a lightweight, TypeScript‑first auth library for Next.js.

- Storage: Uses Drizzle ORM + Postgres via the adapter configured in `src/lib/auth.ts`.
- Data model: `users`, `sessions`, `accounts`, `verifications` in `src/db/schema.ts`.
- Sessions: Sets an HttpOnly cookie and persists session rows in the `sessions` table; server routes read the session via `auth.api.getSession({ headers })`.
- Extra fields: We expose `uuid` and `role` on the session through `additionalFields` for easy server checks.

## Secrets and URLs (entry‑level)

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A long, random server‑only secret used to sign/verify auth tokens and secure cookies. Generate one time and keep it private.
  - Generate: `openssl rand -base64 32`
  - Rotation note: Changing it logs out all users because existing sessions can no longer be verified.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: Server base URL used by the auth library (usually your site URL).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL`: Client‑side base (keep same as site URL in most cases).
- Cookies are `HttpOnly` and `secure` in production (see `advanced.defaultCookieAttributes` in `src/lib/auth.ts`).

If sign‑in seems to work only once or sessions vanish after restart, double‑check these envs and restart the dev server.

## Auth Pipeline Overview

- Library: Better Auth (`src/lib/auth.ts`) with Drizzle adapter to Postgres (`src/db/schema.ts`).
- Users are stored in `users`. Sessions, accounts, and verifications live in `sessions`, `accounts`, `verifications`.
- The session is fetched in App Router via `auth.api.getSession({ headers })`.
- Custom user fields are exposed to the session via `additionalFields` (we include `uuid` and `role`).

## Roles

- `user`: default for everyone.
- `admin_ro`: read‑only admin; can list users, list orders, and view a user’s credit summary.
- `admin_rw`: read + operation admin; includes all read‑only powers and can grant credits to users (`trans_type = system_add`).

Table changes (migration `0001_add_user_role.sql`) add `users.role` with default `user`.

## How Authorization Works

- Helpers in `src/lib/authz.ts` derive the current user’s role from the session/DB only:
  - `requireAdminRead()` → allows `admin_ro`/`admin_rw`.
  - `requireAdminWrite()` → allows `admin_rw`.

## Admin APIs

All endpoints are server‑only and role‑guarded:

- `GET /api/admin/users` → list users. Query: `page`, `limit`.
- `GET /api/admin/orders` → list paid orders. Query: `page`, `limit`.
- `GET /api/admin/users/:uuid/credits` → credit summary + recent ledger.
- `POST /api/admin/credits/grant` → grant credits as `system_add`.

```jsonc
// POST /api/admin/credits/grant body
{
  "userUuid": "<target-user-uuid>",
  "credits": 100,
  "expiredAt": null,     // optional ISO string or null
  "orderNo": "",         // optional
  "note": "promo Q4"     // reserved for future auditing
}
```

## Setup Steps

1) Migrate DB

Run migrations to add the `role` column:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit generate --config src/db/config.ts
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate --config src/db/config.ts
```

This repo includes `src/db/migrations/0001_add_user_role.sql` so a generate is optional if you don’t change the schema further.

2) Verify endpoints

- Call `GET /api/admin/users` as an admin to confirm access.
- Call `POST /api/admin/credits/grant` with a target `userUuid` to add credits; the ledger shows `trans_type = system_add`.

## Changing Roles

Update roles in the database (authoritative source):

- SQL (direct):
  ```sql
  update users set role = 'admin_rw' where uuid = '<uuid>';
  ```
- Update via code helper:
  - `updateUserRole(uuid, 'admin_ro' | 'admin_rw' | 'user')` in `src/models/user.ts`.

## Notes & Tips

- The existing dev endpoint `POST /api/account/credits/grant` is for local testing; lock it down or remove in production in favor of the admin endpoint above.
- Consider adding an audit log table if you need to track who granted credits (operator UUID, timestamp, reason).
- Protect admin accounts with MFA/SSO and shorter session TTLs.
- Only expose admin UI/pages after guarding them on the server (check role in the server component and redirect if unauthorized).
- Roles are not controlled by environment variables; use DB changes for assignment/revocation.

## Social Sign‑In (Google)

- The Google provider is configured in `src/lib/auth.ts` under `socialProviders.google` and reads `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from `.env`.
- Ensure these envs are set: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, plus `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` in development).
- In Google Cloud Console → Credentials, add the Authorized redirect URI:
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (dev)
  - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google` (prod)
- The login screen at `/[locale]/login` shows a “Continue with Google” button that starts the OAuth flow.

## Email & Password

This template enables Better Auth’s email & password authenticator and includes localized “Forgot password” and “Reset password” pages.

- Server config lives in `src/lib/auth.ts` → `emailAndPassword` is enabled and wired with `sendResetPassword` and `onPasswordReset` callbacks.
- Emails are sent via Resend using `src/services/email/send.ts` and the template `src/services/email/templates/reset-password.tsx`.
- UI routes are localized under the App Router:
  - `/[locale]/forgot-password` → request reset link
  - `/[locale]/reset-password?token=...` → set new password
- All UI strings come from `messages/*.json` under the `auth.*` namespace (see `messages/en.json`).

### Client usage

```ts
// Request a reset link
await authClient.requestPasswordReset({
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  redirectTo: "/en/reset-password", // locale-aware in app
});

// Reset password (token comes from the reset link)
await authClient.resetPassword({
  newPassword: "newpassword1234",
  token,
});
```

### Pages & Components

- Components: `src/components/auth/forgot-password-form.tsx`, `src/components/auth/reset-password-form.tsx` (client components; i18n with `next-intl`).
- Pages: thin wrappers at `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx` and `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx` render the components.

### Environment

- Required: `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`.
- Optional: `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL` for client in edge cases.

### Manual check

1. Visit `/[locale]/forgot-password`, submit a known user email.
2. Open the email and follow the link to `reset-password?token=...`.
3. Set a new password and sign in at `/[locale]/login`.
