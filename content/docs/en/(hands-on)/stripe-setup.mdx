## Overview

This template uses Stripe Checkout for payments and a credit ledger to grant usage credits after purchase.

- UI: `/[locale]/pricing` shows plans from a typed config.
- Create session: client calls `POST /api/checkout` to create a Stripe Checkout session and redirects to Stripe.
- Redirect back: Stripe sends the user to `/api/pay/callback/stripe` (GET) after checkout.
- Finalize server-side: Stripe sends a webhook to `/api/pay/webhook/stripe` (POST). The webhook marks the order paid and grants credits.

The webhook is the source of truth; the callback is only for browser navigation and is safe to keep as a secondary path (code is idempotent if it runs twice).

---

## Endpoints

- `/api/checkout` (POST):
  - Validates the selected plan against `src/data/pricing.ts`.
  - Creates a Stripe Checkout session (inline price data; no Stripe Products required).
  - Inserts an `orders` row with status `created` and returns `checkout_url`.

- `/api/pay/callback/stripe` (GET):
  - Used by Stripe Checkout success redirect. Fetches the session for logging, then redirects the user to your success or failure page.
  - Note: Server-of-record updates happen in the webhook.

- `/api/pay/webhook/stripe` (POST):
  - Verifies the Stripe signature.
  - Handles `checkout.session.completed` and calls `handleCheckoutSession` to mark the order paid and grant credits.

---

## Credits Flow

On successful payment:

1) We look up the order by `order_no` in session metadata.
2) Update the order to `paid` and persist relevant payment details.
3) Insert a positive ledger row in `credits` (`trans_type: order_pay`) for the purchased amount. The balance reflects non-expired positive entries minus all consumption entries.

---

## Prerequisites

Set these variables in `.env.local` and restart dev:

```bash
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=sk_test_...            # Test mode secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...           # From Stripe CLI / dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000 # External URL for callbacks
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_CANCEL_URL=/pricing       # Optional; relative or absolute
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_SUCCESS_URL=/pricing      # Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_FAIL_URL=/pricing         # Optional
```

Notes:

- `src/integrations/stripe.ts` expects `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY` (your Stripe secret key).

---

## Local Webhook Setup

Use the Stripe CLI to forward events to your local endpoint.

```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/pay/webhook/stripe
```

When `stripe listen` starts, it prints a `whsec_...` secret — copy it to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Trigger a test checkout completion:

```bash
stripe trigger checkout_session_completed
```

Common gotcha: triggering `payment_intent.succeeded` will hit your webhook but is ignored unless you add a handler for it. This template listens to `checkout.session.completed`.

---

## Try It

1) Sign up and sign in via `/[locale]/signup` and `/[locale]/login`.
2) Visit `/[locale]/pricing` and click a plan.
3) Complete the Stripe Checkout with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
4) Stripe redirects to the callback URL; the webhook finalizes your order and grants credits.
5) Verify credits at `/[locale]/credits-test` or via `POST /api/account/credits`.

If you enable RMB/WeChat Pay, ensure those payment methods are active in your Stripe test account. Otherwise, start with USD + card.

---

## Implementation Details

- Plans live in `src/data/pricing.ts`. Values are typed (`Pricing`), shared by the pricing page and `/api/checkout`.
- Orders are stored in `orders`; credit movements in `credits`.
- The webhook verifies signatures using the raw request body and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- `handleCheckoutSession` supports both one-time and subscription checkouts:
  - Payment mode: uses `session.payment_intent`.
  - Subscription mode: fetches the latest invoice’s payment intent from the subscription.

---

## Products vs Prices (Stripe)

Stripe separates the catalog item (Product) from how it’s sold (Price):

- Product (`prod_...`): name/description, catalog metadata; a single Product can have many Prices.
- Price (`price_...`): currency, amount, recurring interval (month/year), trials, tax behavior, tiers. Subscriptions attach to a Price.

Why we reference Price IDs in Checkout

- Subscriptions need exact commercial terms. Attaching to a `price_...` enables proper renewals, proration, trials, and Stripe Tax.
- Renewals reference the same Price on invoice lines so our webhook can map the plan and grant credits each cycle.
- Operationally safer than ad‑hoc prices: you manage amounts and rules in Stripe; code stays stable.

Finding your Price IDs in Stripe

1) Dashboard → Products → pick your product.
2) In the Prices table, click the 3 dots at the end of the row → “Copy price ID”.
3) It begins with `price_...` — don’t confuse it with the Product ID (`prod_...`).

Environment variables (optional but recommended)

```bash
# Map your plan config to Stripe Prices; if empty, checkout falls back to inline prices
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_LAUNCH_MONTHLY=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_SCALE_MONTHLY=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_LAUNCH_YEARLY=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_SCALE_YEARLY=price_...
# Optional CNY variants
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_LAUNCH_MONTHLY_CNY=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_SCALE_MONTHLY_CNY=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_LAUNCH_YEARLY_CNY=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_SCALE_YEARLY_CNY=price_...
```

Behavior with/without Price IDs

- If a Price ID is set for a subscription plan, Checkout uses it directly.
- If not, Checkout creates the session with inline `price_data` using amounts from `src/data/pricing.ts` (safe fallback).

---

## Renewals and Credits

This template handles renewals automatically:

- Webhook `invoice.payment_succeeded` (with `billing_reason=subscription_cycle`) creates a renewal Order and grants plan credits for the period.
- Idempotency: we skip if an Order already exists for the same `(subscription_id, period_start)`.
- Initial purchase still uses `checkout.session.completed`; we avoid double‑crediting by ignoring non‑cycle invoices.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Persist additional Stripe IDs (subscription, invoice) alongside orders for richer admin views.
- Add idempotency keys if you extend the flow to multiple writes per event.

---

## Billing & Subscriptions

### Customer Portal

Enable Stripe’s Customer Portal in the dashboard and customize the features you want (cancel/resume, update payment method, view invoices).

This template exposes:

- API: `GET /api/billing/portal` — creates a portal session and redirects to Stripe
- UI: `/:locale/account/billing` — contains a “Manage billing” button that opens the portal

Implementation:

- API route: `src/app/api/billing/portal/route.ts`
  - Finds or creates a Stripe Customer by the signed-in user’s email
  - Creates a portal session with a `return_url` back to `/:locale/account/billing`

Usage in the UI (server component):

- `src/app/[locale]/account/billing/page.tsx` renders a link to `/api/billing/portal?locale=<locale>`

### Dunning (Failed Payments)

Webhook: `invoice.payment_failed` is handled to send a friendly “update your payment method” email via Resend.

- Template: `src/services/email/templates/payment-failed.tsx`
- Sender: `sendPaymentFailedEmail()` in `src/services/email/send.ts`
- Webhook wiring: see `src/app/api/pay/webhook/stripe/route.ts`

Local test via Stripe CLI:

```bash
stripe trigger invoice_payment_failed
```

Note: Emails include a link back to `/:locale/account/billing` so users can open the Customer Portal from your app.

---

## Reminder: Forward Webhooks During Testing

When testing locally (or against any non‑production URL), make sure Stripe forwards events to your environment; otherwise payments will complete but credits/orders won’t be finalized.

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/pay/webhook/stripe
```

If you use a tunnel or remote domain, forward to that full URL instead of localhost.
